// Use the input capture mode of the ATMEGA328 counter1 to precisely 
// compare a to-be-adjusted 1 pulse-per-second signal against a known-good
// one pps signal (say from a gps receiver), and display the difference
// between the two as a bar graph where each bar corresponds to 1 ppm 
// (or better) difference between the two.
//
// At March 11, 2012 the development has progressed to having the basic
// function as described working. A clock using a PCF8563 I2C rtc chip,
// with an I2C 16X2 LCD display and various bells and whistles was 
// developed separately, then the input-capture interrupt handlers and
// bar graph display (also separate development) were added. The initial
// hardware interface uses the 1 pps output from the clock chip as both
// the reference and to-be-adjusted inputs--the falling edge triggers the
// IC interrupt, and the rising edge triggers external interrupt 0. The
// display shows the difference (in .5 ppm bars) between the (accurate)
// IC input--pin 8--time interval and the external interrupt0--pin 2--
// time interval, as well as the clock's time, date, and alarm functions.
